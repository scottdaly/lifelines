# LifeLines Implementation Review & Recommendations

## Executive Summary

This document reviews the current implementation of LifeLines against the original technical specification, focusing on age progression, scenario generation, and choice presentation. While the core architecture is solid, there are significant opportunities to enhance engagement and align more closely with the original vision.

**Last Updated: 2025-07-20** - Implemented Dynamic Turn Structure with variable progression, milestones, and sub-turns. Added custom action support. Implemented Hierarchical Memory System for narrative continuity.

## Current Implementation Overview

### Age Progression System

**Current State:**
- ~~Ages advance in fixed increments based on life stage (3 years for infancy/childhood, 2 years for tween, 1 year thereafter)~~
- ~~Only high school has sub-turns (Fall/Spring/Summer)~~
- ~~Age milestones trigger generic messages ("You enter the world of formal education")~~
- ~~Progression is purely linear with no variation~~

**UPDATE (2025-07-20)**: Dynamic turn system now implemented:
- Variable turn progression with configurable variance (±1-2 years per stage)
- Sub-turns triggered dynamically by significant events across all life stages
- Contextual milestone narratives based on turn type and life circumstances
- Narrative pressure system ensures interesting events when life becomes routine

**Strengths:**
- ~~Clean, predictable progression~~
- ~~Stage-appropriate turn spans~~
- Dynamic progression adapts to player choices and life events
- Rich sub-turn sequences for major life moments
- Milestone ages (1, 5, 13, 16, 18, 21, 30, 40, 50, 65, etc.) with special narratives

**Gaps:**
- ~~No procedural variation in aging speed~~ ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- ~~Limited narrative variety for age transitions~~ ✅ IMPLEMENTED
- ~~Sub-turns only implemented for high school~~ ✅ IMPLEMENTED

### Scenario & Narrative Generation

**Current State:**
- LLM generates narratives with a 120-word limit
- System prompt includes stage tags to guide content
- Stat changes limited to -20 to +20 per turn
- Event titles paired with stat changes in terminal display

**Strengths:**
- Consistent JSON output format
- Stage-aware content generation
- Clean terminal presentation

**Gaps:**
- Narratives feel generic and disconnected
- No memory of significant past events beyond last 5
- Limited use of traits in narrative generation
- No procedural event pools or weighted scenarios

### Choice Presentation

**Current State:**
- 3-5 choices generated by LLM per turn
- Choices have tags but they're not utilized
- Hot-key navigation (1-5)
- Visual feedback when choices are disabled

**Strengths:**
- Clean UI with keyboard shortcuts
- Good visual states for interaction

**Gaps:**
- No custom action input as specified
- Choice tags unused for theming or consequences
- Choices feel random rather than consequential
- No clear connection between choices and life trajectory

## Comparison with Original Vision

### Missing Core Features

1. **Procedural Life Elements** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Spec: "Seeded stats, traits, birthplace, and era make each run unique"
   - Reality: ~~Limited procedural generation, no era system, minimal trait impact~~
   - **UPDATE (2025-07-19)**: Fully implemented procedural generation system including:
     - 20+ trait definitions across 4 categories (personality, background, physical, circumstantial)
     - 12 diverse birthplaces with unique characteristics and stat modifiers
     - 5 time periods (1980s-2020s) with era-specific attributes
     - Family background generation with socioeconomic status and parent professions
     - Trait evolution paths and stat correlations
     - Contextual narrative generation based on all procedural elements

2. **Dynamic Turn Structure** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
   - Spec: Multi-year macro-turns with meaningful sub-turns
   - Reality: ~~Fixed progression with sub-turns only in high school~~
   - **UPDATE (2025-07-20)**: Fully implemented dynamic turn system including:
     - Variable turn spans (1-5 years) based on life stage and narrative pressure
     - Context-aware sub-turns triggered by significant events
     - Milestone age system with special narratives
     - Time-skip narratives for multi-year progressions
     - Dynamic turn types: normal, milestone, sub-turn, and time-skip

3. **Player Agency**
   - Spec: "Choose among 4-5 options *or* type a custom action"
   - Reality: No custom action support

4. **Relationship Depth**
   - Spec: "Dynamic relationships... continuously reshape meters"
   - Reality: Basic relationship tracking with limited narrative integration

## Recommendations for Enhancement

### 1. Enrich Age Progression ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**Variable Turn Spans:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
```typescript
// UPDATE (2025-07-20): Now part of StageConfig
export interface StageConfig {
  // ...existing fields
  turnSpanVariance?: number; // Random variance in years
  eventDensity: 'sparse' | 'normal' | 'dense'; // How often significant events occur
  milestoneAges?: number[]; // Special ages that always trigger a turn
  dynamicSubTurnTriggers?: string[]; // Event tags that can trigger sub-turns
}
```

**Contextual Age Milestones:** ✅ IMPLEMENTED
The system now generates milestone narratives based on:
- Turn type (milestone, sub-turn, time-skip)
- Narrative pressure level
- Character progression context

Examples of implemented narratives:
- Milestone at 5: "A significant threshold approaches - soon you'll enter the world of formal learning."
- Milestone at 18: "The legal threshold of adulthood - society now sees you differently."
- Time-skip: "3 years pass in a blur of ordinary moments..."

### 2. Implement Memory & Continuity ✅ IMPLEMENTED

**UPDATE (2025-07-20)**: Hierarchical Memory System has been fully implemented:

**Event Memory System:**
```typescript
export interface MemorySystem {
  memories: Record<string, Memory>;
  themes: Record<string, Theme>;
  coreMemoryIds: string[]; // Max 7-10 formative experiences
}

export interface Memory {
  id: string;
  eventId: string;
  type: 'core' | 'significant' | 'ordinary';
  emotionalValence: number; // -1 to 1 (negative to positive)
  intensity: number; // 0-1
  associations: string[]; // Related memory IDs
  lastAccessed: number;
  accessCount: number;
  age: number; // Age when memory was formed
}
```

**Implementation Details:**
- **Memory Formation**: Events evaluated for significance based on stat changes, relationships, milestones, and age
- **Theme Detection**: 10 predefined themes (academic_excellence, family_loyalty, etc.) detected from event content
- **Smart Retrieval**: Context-aware memory selection based on relevance, recency, and emotional resonance
- **Memory Callbacks**: Anniversary, parallel situation, and emotional echo references in narratives
- **Memory Decay**: Automatic management to maintain ~100 memories, preserving core memories
- **LLM Integration**: Core memories, relevant past experiences, and active themes provided as context

### 3. Enhanced Choice Generation

**Choice Categories:**
1. **Proactive** - Shape your path (tagged: ambitious, creative, social)
2. **Reactive** - Respond to events (tagged: defensive, adaptive, confrontational)
3. **Reflective** - Internal growth (tagged: introspective, philosophical)
4. **Social** - Relationship focused (tagged with specific NPC IDs)

**Choice Weighting System:**
```typescript
interface ChoiceWeight {
  baseWeight: number;
  traitModifiers: Record<string, number>;
  stageModifiers: Record<LifeStage, number>;
  contextModifiers: {
    recentEvents?: string[];
    relationshipStates?: Record<string, number>;
  };
}
```

### 4. Procedural Event Pools

Create themed event pools for each life stage:

```typescript
interface EventPool {
  stage: LifeStage;
  events: ProcEventTemplate[];
}

interface ProcEventTemplate {
  id: string;
  weight: number;
  requirements?: {
    minAge?: number;
    traits?: string[];
    minStats?: Partial<Stats>;
    relationships?: RelationshipRequirement[];
  };
  outcomes: EventOutcome[];
}
```

### 5. Custom Action Support

Implement the missing custom action feature:

```typescript
interface CustomActionHandler {
  validateAction(input: string): boolean;
  generatePrompt(action: string, context: GameState): string;
  processResponse(response: LLMResponse): TurnResponse;
}
```

**UI Addition:**
- Add text input below numbered choices
- Include examples: "Type your own action... (e.g., 'Start a lemonade stand', 'Write in my diary')"
- Validate for inappropriate content before sending to LLM

### 6. Trait Evolution System

Make traits dynamic rather than static:

```typescript
interface TraitEvolution {
  baseTrait: string;
  evolution: {
    condition: string;
    newTrait: string;
    narrative: string;
  }[];
}

// Example:
{
  baseTrait: "shy",
  evolution: [
    {
      condition: "charisma > 60",
      newTrait: "quietly confident",
      narrative: "Your shyness has evolved into a quiet confidence."
    }
  ]
}
```

### 7. Era System ✅ IMPLEMENTED

~~Add temporal variety:~~

**UPDATE (2025-07-19)**: Era system has been fully implemented with:

```typescript
interface EraDefinition {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  yearRange: [number, number];
  characteristics: {
    technology: {
      level: number; // 1-10 scale
      prevalentTech: string[];
    };
    society: {
      values: string[];
      economicClimate: 'recession' | 'stable' | 'growth' | 'boom';
      majorEvents: string[];
    };
  };
  eventModifiers: Record<string, number>;
}
```

Current eras include:
- **1980s**: Limited technology, traditional values
- **1990s**: Emerging internet, economic optimism
- **2000s**: Social media dawn, post-9/11 world
- **2010s**: Smartphone era, social awareness
- **2020s**: Post-pandemic, AI emergence

## Dynamic Turn System Implementation Details

**UPDATE (2025-07-20)**: The Dynamic Turn Structure has been fully implemented with the following components:

### DynamicTurnCalculator Class
Located in `/backend/src/utils/dynamicTurns.ts`, this class handles:
- **Narrative Pressure Calculation**: Tracks recent significant events and increases pressure when life becomes routine
- **Milestone Detection**: Identifies both stage-specific and global milestone ages
- **Sub-turn Triggering**: Checks recent events for tags that trigger multi-part sequences
- **Turn Progression**: Calculates years to advance based on all factors while preventing milestone skipping

### Sub-turn System
Comprehensive sub-turn sequences for major life events:
- **Infancy**: first_words, first_steps, health_scare, parent_separation
- **Childhood**: first_day_school, family_crisis, major_achievement, family_move
- **Tween**: first_crush, major_conflict, identity_crisis
- **High School**: relationship_start, college_prep, major_decision
- **Young Adult**: graduation, first_job, engagement, career_change
- **Adult**: marriage, childbirth, divorce, career_milestone, loss
- **Senior**: retirement, grandchild, health_crisis, loss_of_spouse

### UI Enhancements
- Current sub-turn displayed in game header with yellow highlight
- Turn type indicators in terminal feed ([MILESTONE AGE], [3 YEARS PASS], etc.)
- Narrative pressure meter in stats panel showing drama level (LOW/MED/HIGH)
- Enhanced age transition narratives based on turn context

### Integration Points
- `advanceTime()` in stageUtils.ts now uses DynamicTurnCalculator
- Turn controller passes DynamicTurnContext to LLM for context-aware narratives
- Save/load system updated with backward compatibility for new fields
- Frontend types synchronized with backend for type safety

## Memory System Implementation Details

**UPDATE (2025-07-20)**: The Hierarchical Memory System has been fully implemented with the following components:

### MemoryProcessor Class
Located in `/backend/src/utils/memoryProcessor.ts`, this class handles:
- **Significance Evaluation**: Calculates memory importance based on stat changes, relationships, milestones, and age
- **Memory Type Classification**: Determines if memories are core (formative), significant, or ordinary
- **Emotional Valence**: Assesses positive/negative emotional impact (-1 to 1)
- **Memory Associations**: Links related memories based on shared tags and relationships
- **Memory Decay**: Manages memory limit (~100) by removing least significant ordinary memories

### ThemeDetector Class
Located in `/backend/src/utils/themeDetector.ts`, this class handles:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Detects themes from event tags and content
- **Theme Tracking**: Monitors 10 predefined themes (academic_excellence, family_loyalty, romantic_journey, etc.)
- **Strength Evolution**: Themes strengthen with reinforcement, decay when unused
- **Theme Narratives**: Provides descriptive text for active themes

### MemoryRetriever Class
Located in `/backend/src/utils/memoryRetriever.ts`, this class handles:
- **Context-Aware Retrieval**: Scores memories based on relevance to current situation
- **Anniversary Detection**: Identifies significant time-based memory triggers
- **Emotional Resonance**: Matches memories to current emotional state
- **Theme-Based Retrieval**: Finds memories related to active life themes

### CallbackGenerator Class
Located in `/backend/src/utils/callbackGenerator.ts`, this class handles:
- **Anniversary Callbacks**: "It's been 10 years since..."
- **Parallel Situations**: "Just like when you were 5..."
- **Emotional Echoes**: "You haven't felt this way since..."
- **Narrative Integration**: Formats callbacks for terminal display

### UI Components
- **MemoryIndicator**: Displays memory callbacks in terminal with special formatting
- **CoreMemoriesPanel**: Shows formative experiences and life themes with visual progress bars

### Integration Points
- Turn controller processes events into memories after each turn
- LLM receives memory context including core memories, relevant past, and active themes
- Memory callbacks appear inline in narrative with special formatting
- Frontend displays core memories and themes in dedicated panel

## Technical Considerations

### LLM Prompt Optimization

Current prompt is functional but could be enhanced:
- Include recent significant events in context
- Add character voice/personality guidelines based on traits
- Implement few-shot examples for better choice generation

**UPDATE (2025-07-19)**: Prompt has been enhanced to include:
- Full procedural background context (birthplace, era, family)
- Trait definitions and their effects
- Era-specific technology and social values
- Family socioeconomic status and parent professions

**UPDATE (2025-07-20)**: Further enhanced with:
- Dynamic turn context (milestone, sub-turn, time-skip)
- Narrative pressure guidance for event significance
- Sub-turn context and triggers
- Years progressing information for appropriate narrative pacing
- Custom action interpretation with generous but age-appropriate handling
- Memory context including core memories, relevant past experiences, and active themes
- Instructions to reference memories and themes for narrative continuity

### Performance

- Consider caching common event templates
- Implement progressive narrative loading for longer stories
- Add option to skip typewriter effect for repeat players

### Testing

- Create deterministic test scenarios with fixed seeds
- Build automated playtesting for balance
- Add telemetry to track which choices players select most
